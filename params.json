  "body": "###Hello,\r\n\r\n###I’m a senior computer science student. I was working on a machine learning task to classify text, and I kept searching for a machine learning library to use. This task might seem too easy, but when it comes to a blind programmer who is new to machine learning, it wasn’t really easy to find a library with accessible documentations. \r\n\r\n###\tUntil I found Vowpal Wabbit (VW). I started to use this library that has very good documentations, and it has been developed by Yahoo research in the past, and by Microsoft research currently. \r\n\r\n###\tDue to the fact that the library is a running project, it doesn’t have built in functions to calculate some values such as precision/recall/accuracy/etc. \r\n\r\n###\tThus, I decided to code that by myself, and I thought to share that with the OpenSource community so that no one will have to re-implement that again. \r\n\r\n###\tIt’s not a great project, but I believe it helps. Also, I sent to the Vowpal Wabbit developers asking to be added to contribute to the project even if I’ll update the documentation only.\r\n",
